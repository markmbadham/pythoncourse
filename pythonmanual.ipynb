It is good for simple quick-and-dirty scripts, as well as complex and intricate applications.\nIt is also a dynamically typed language that includes (but does not require one to use) object oriented features and constructs.  Python supports many other programming paradigms including functional programming and aspect oriented programming. \nImplementations\n\nPython refers to programming language specification rather than an implementation.  The reference implementation for Python is called *CPython*.  *CPython* (written in C), behaves like an interpreter but in fact automatically compiles the Python code to byte-code before execution (the byte-code  then may be saved to disk, just as automatically, so that compilation need not happen again until and unless the source gets changed). \nOther popular implementations of Python include *IronPython* and *Jython*.  IronPython creates CIL byte code for the dot net runtime environment, and thus can use dot net classes.  Jython compiles to Java Byte code and similarly can use Java Classes."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Versions\n\nThere are two current versions of Python - 2.7 and 3.3.  This is because Python 3x is not compatible with Python 2x.  Most software projects are still based on Python 2x.  The most obvious difference you will notice between Python 2x and Python 3x is that print is a statement in 2x and a function in 3x.   "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Easy to learn\n\nPython supports reflection and introspection. The `dir()` function returns the list of the names of objects in the current scope. However, `dir(object)` will return the names of the attributes of the specified object. The `locals()` routine returns a dictionary in which the names in the local namespace are the keys and their values are the objects to which the names refer. Combined with the interactive interpreter, this provides a useful environment for exploration and prototyping.\n\nThe  `help()` command also provides information on how to use objects.\nThe most unusual aspect of Python is that whitespace is significant; instead of block delimiters (braces → \"`{}`\" in the C family of languages).  Indentation is used to indicate where blocks begin and end.\nFor example, the following Python code can be interactively typed at an interpreter prompt, to display the beginning values in the Fibonacci series:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":">>> a,b = 0,1\n>>> print(b)\n1\n>>> while b < 100:\n...   a,b = b,(a+b)\n...   print(b, end=\" \")\n...

For example, loop constructs that can iterate over items in a collection instead of being limited to a simple range of integer values. Python also comes with a powerful standard library, which includes hundreds of modules to provide routines for a wide variety of services including regular expressions and TCP/IP sessions.\n\n## Open Source\nPython is used and supported by a large Python Community that exists on the Internet. The mailing lists and news groups like the tutor list actively support and help new python programmers. While they discourage doing homework for you, they are quite helpful and are populated by the authors of many of the Python textbooks currently available on the market. Python is named after *Monty Python's Flying Circus* comedy program and was created by Guido Van Rossum.\nGetting Python\n\n## Installation\nIn order to program in Python you need the Python interpreter. If it is not already installed or if the version you are using is obsolete, you will need to obtain and install Python using the methods below:\n\n### Installing Python in Windows\n\nGo to the Python Homepage https://www.python.org/downloads/ or the ActiveState website and get the proper version for your platform. Download it, read the instructions and get it installed.\n\nIn order to run Python from the command line, you will need to have the python directory in your PATH.  Alternatively, you could use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Python.  Microsoft Visual Studio Code is currently the most popular, Pycharm, PyDEV(Eclipse), DrPython, eric, PyScripter, Spyder, or Python's own IDLE (which ships with every version of Python since 2.3).\n\nThe PATH variable can be modified from the Window's System control panel.  The advanced tab will contain the button labeled Environment Variables, where you can append the newly created folder to the search path.\nIf you prefer having a temporary environment, you can create a new command prompt shortcut that automatically executes the following statement:\n\n`PATH %PATH%;c:\\python26`\n\nChanging the \"26\" for the version of Python you have (26 is 2.6.x, the current version of Python 2)\n\n### Installing Python on Mac\nUsers on Apple Mac OS X will find that it already ships with Python 2.3 (OS X 10.4 Tiger), but if you want the more recent version head to Python Download Page follow the instruction on the page and in the installers. As a bonus you will also install the Python IDE.\n\n### Installing Python on Unix environments\nPython is available as a package for some Linux distributions. In some cases, the distribution CD will contain the python package for installation, while other distributions require downloading the source code and using the compilation scripts.\nGentoo GNU/Linux\nGentoo is an example of a distribution that installs Python by default - the package system Portage depends on Python.\nUbuntu GNU/Linux\nUsers of Ubuntu 6.04 (Dapper Drake) and earlier will notice that Python comes installed by default, only it sometimes is not the latest version. If you would like to update it, just open a terminal and type at the prompt:\n\n```\n$ sudo apt-get update  # This will update the software repository\n$ sudo apt-get install python   # This one will actually install python\n```\n\n### Source code installations\nSome platforms do not have a version of Python installed, and do not have pre-compiled binaries. In these cases, you will need to download the source code from the official site. Once the download is complete, you will need to unpack the compressed archive into a folder.\nTo build Python, simply run the configure script (requires the Bash shell) and compile using make.\nInteractive mode\nPython has two basic modes: The normal \"mode\" is the mode where the scripted and finished .py files are run in the python interpreter.  Interactive mode is a command line shell which gives immediate feedback for each statement, while running previously fed statements in active memory. As new lines are fed into the interpreter, the fed program is evaluated both in part and in whole."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To get into interactive mode, simply type \"python\" without any arguments.

This tutorial will show you how to start writing programs.\nPython programs are nothing more than text files, and they may be edited with a standard text editor program.  What text editor you use will probably depend on your operating system; any text editor can create Python programs.  It is easier to use a text editor that includes Python syntax highlighting.\n\n## Hello, World!\nThe first program that every programmer writes is called the \"Hello, World!\" program. This program simply outputs the phrase \"Hello, World!\" and then quits. Let's write \"Hello, World!\" in Python!\nOpen up your text editor and create a new file called hello.py containing just this line (you can copy-paste if you want):\nFor Python 3x"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Hello, world!\") ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"For Python 2x"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"print \"Hello, world!\"  ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This program uses the print function, which simply outputs its parameters to the terminal. print ends with a newline character, which simply moves the cursor to the next line.\nNow that you've written your first program, let's run it in Python! This process differs slightly depending on your operating system.\nNOTE:\nIn Python 2.x, print is a statement rather than a function. As such, it printed everything until the end of the line, it did not utilize parenthesis and required using a stand alone comma after the final printed item to identify that the current line was not yet complete.\nWindows\n   - Create a folder on your computer to use for your Python programs, such as C:\\pythonpractice, and save your hello.py program in that folder. \n   - In the Start menu, select \"Run...\", and type in cmd. This is cause the Windows terminal to open. \n   - Type cd \\pythonpractice to change directory to your pythonpractice folder, and hit Enter. \n   - Type python hello.py to run your program! \nIf it didn't work, make sure your PATH contains the python directory. See Getting Python.\nMac\n   - Create a folder on your computer to use for your Python programs. A good suggestion would be to name it pythonpractice and place it in your Home folder (the one that contains folders for Documents, Movies, Music, Pictures, etc). Save your hello.py program into this folder. \n   - Open the Applications folder, go into the Utilities folder, and open the Terminal program. \n   - Type cd pythonpractice to change directory to your pythonpractice folder, and hit Enter. \n   - Type python hello.py to run your program! \nLinux\n   - Create a folder on your computer to use for your Python programs, such as ~/pythonpractice, and save your hello.py program in that folder. \n   - Open up the terminal program. In KDE, open the main menu and select \"Run Command...\" to open Konsole. In GNOME, open the main menu, open the Applications folder, open the Accessories folder, and select Terminal. \n   - Type cd ~/pythonpractice to change directory to your pythonpractice folder, and hit Enter. \n   - Type python hello.py to run your program! \nResult\nThe program should print:\nHello, world!\nCongratulations! You're well on your way to becoming a Python programmer.\nExercises\n    1. Modify the hello.py program to say hello to a historical political leader (or to Ada Lovelace). \n    2. Change the program so that after the greeting, it asks, \"How did you get here?\". \n    3. Re-write the original program to use two print statements: one for \"Hello\" and one for \"world\". The program should still only print out on one line. \n        "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Basic syntax\nThere are four fundamental concepts affecting Python syntax.\n1. Case Sensitivity\nAll variables are case-sensitive. Python treats 'number' and 'Number' as separate, unrelated entities.\n2. Logical lines\nStatements in Python occupy one logical line.  That is a newline normally terminates a Python statement.  A logical line can be extended by:\n    - a backslash (\\) at the end of the line\n    - opening a bracket, any of `(` `[` `{` will extend the logical line until the corresponding closing bracket.\n    - Opening a triple quoted string.  Either `'''` or `\"\"\"` will open as string literal and the logical line does not end until the string literal is closed.\n\n### Indentation \nA block of code starts with a colon (`:`) and ends with an un-indent.  Because whitespace is significant, remember that spaces and tabs don't mix, so use only one or the other when indenting your programs. A common error is to mix them. While they may look the same in editor, the interpreter will read them differently and it will result in either an error or unexpected behavior. Most decent text editors can be configured to let tab key emit spaces instead.\nPython's Style Guideline describes that the preferred way is using 4 spaces.\n\nTips: If you invoked python from the command-line, you can give -t or -tt argument to python to make python issue a warning or error on inconsistent tab usage.\npythonprogrammer@wikibook:~$ `python -tt myscript.py`\nThis will issue an error if you mixed spaces and tabs."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Objects\n\nIn Python, like all object oriented languages, there are aggregations of code and data called Objects.  These typically represent the pieces in a conceptual model of a system.\nObjects in Python are created (i.e., instantiated) from templates called Classes (which are covered later, as much of the language can be used without understanding classes). They have \"attributes\", which represent the various pieces of code and data which comprise the object. To access attributes, one writes the name of the object followed by a period (henceforth called a dot), followed by the name of the attribute.\nAn example is the 'upper' attribute of strings, which refers to the code that returns a copy of the string in which all the letters are uppercase. To get to this, it is necessary to have a way to refer to the object (in the following example, the way is the literal string that constructs the object).\n`'bob'.upper`\nCode attributes are called \"methods\". So in this example, upper is a method of 'bob' (as it is of all strings). To execute the code in a method, use a matched pair of parentheses surrounding a comma separated list of whatever arguments the method accepts (upper doesn't accept any arguments). So to find an uppercase version of the string 'bob', one could use the following:\n`'bob'.upper()`\n\n### Scope\nIn a large system, it is important that one piece of code does not affect another in difficult to predict ways.  One of the simplest ways to further this goal is to prevent one programmer's choice of names from preventing another from choosing that name.  Because of this, the concept of scope was invented.  A scope is a \"region\" of code in which a name can be used and outside of which the name cannot be easily accessed.  There are two ways of delimiting regions in Python: with functions or with modules.  They each have different ways of accessing the useful data that was produced within the scope from outside the scope.  With functions, that way is to return the data.  The way to access names from other modules lead us to another concept.\n\n### Namespaces\nIt would be possible to teach Python without the concept of namespaces because they are so similar to attributes, which we have already mentioned, but the concept of namespaces is one that transcends any particular programming language, and so it is important to teach. To begin with, there is a built-in function dir() that can be used to help one understand the concept of namespaces. When you first start the Python interpreter (i.e., in interactive mode), you can list the objects in the current (or default) namespace using this function.\n```python\nPython 2.3.4 (#53, Oct 18 2004, 20:35:07) [MSC v.1200 32 bit (Intel)] on win32\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> dir()\n['__builtins__', '__doc__', '__name__']\n```\n\n```python\nPython 3.3.1 (default, Sep 25 2013, 19:29:01) \n[GCC 4.7.3] on linux\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> dir()\n['__builtins__', '__doc__', '__loader__', '__name__', '__package__']\n```\nThis function can also be used to show the names available within a module namespace. To demonstrate this, first we can use the `type()` function to show what `__builtins__` is:\n```python\n>>> type(__builtins__)\n<type 'module'>\n```\n\nSince it is a module, we can list the names within the __builtins__ namespace, again using the dir() function (note the complete list of names has been abbreviated):"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":">>> dir(__builtins__)","execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":"['ArithmeticError',\n 'AssertionError',\n 'AttributeError',\n 'BaseException',\n 'BlockingIOError',\n 'BrokenPipeError',\n 'BufferError',\n 'BytesWarning',\n 'ChildProcessError',\n 'ConnectionAbortedError',\n 'ConnectionError',\n 'ConnectionRefusedError',\n 'ConnectionResetError',\n 'DeprecationWarning',\n 'EOFError',\n 'Ellipsis',\n 'EnvironmentError',\n 'Exception',\n 'False',\n 'FileExistsError',\n 'FileNotFoundError',\n 'FloatingPointError',\n 'FutureWarning',\n 'GeneratorExit',\n 'IOError',\n 'ImportError',\n 'ImportWarning',\n 'IndentationError',\n 'IndexError',\n 'InterruptedError',\n 'IsADirectoryError',\n 'KeyError',\n 'KeyboardInterrupt',\n 'LookupError',\n 'MemoryError',\n 'ModuleNotFoundError',\n 'NameError',\n 'None',\n 'NotADirectoryError',\n 'NotImplemented',\n 'NotImplementedError',\n 'OSError',\n 'OverflowError',\n 'PendingDeprecationWarning',\n 'PermissionError',\n 'ProcessLookupError',\n 'RecursionError',\n 'ReferenceError',\n 'ResourceWarning',\n 'RuntimeError',\n 'RuntimeWarning',\n 'StopAsyncIteration',\n 'StopIteration',\n 'SyntaxError',\n 'SyntaxWarning',\n 'SystemError',\n 'SystemExit',\n 'TabError',\n 'TimeoutError',\n 'True',\n 'TypeError',\n 'UnboundLocalError',\n 'UnicodeDecodeError',\n 'UnicodeEncodeError',\n 'UnicodeError',\n 'UnicodeTranslateError',\n 'UnicodeWarning',\n 'UserWarning',\n 'ValueError',\n 'Warning',\n 'WindowsError',\n 'ZeroDivisionError',\n '__IPYTHON__',\n '__build_class__',\n '__debug__',\n '__doc__',\n '__import__',\n '__loader__',\n '__name__',\n '__package__',\n '__spec__',\n 'abs',\n 'all',\n 'any',\n 'ascii',\n 'bin',\n 'bool',\n 'breakpoint',\n 'bytearray',\n 'bytes',\n 'callable',\n 'chr',\n 'classmethod',\n 'compile',\n 'complex',\n 'copyright',\n 'credits',\n 'delattr',\n 'dict',\n 'dir',\n 'display',\n 'divmod',\n 'enumerate',\n 'eval',\n 'exec',\n 'filter',\n 'float',\n 'format',\n 'frozenset',\n 'get_ipython',\n 'getattr',\n 'globals',\n 'hasattr',\n 'hash',\n 'help',\n 'hex',\n 'id',\n 'input',\n 'int',\n 'isinstance',\n 'issubclass',\n 'iter',\n 'len',\n 'license',\n 'list',\n 'locals',\n 'map',\n 'max',\n 'memoryview',\n 'min',\n 'next',\n 'object',\n 'oct',\n 'open',\n 'ord',\n 'pow',\n 'print',\n 'property',\n 'range',\n 'repr',\n 'reversed',\n 'round',\n 'set',\n 'setattr',\n 'slice',\n 'sorted',\n 'staticmethod',\n 'str',\n 'sum',\n 'super',\n 'tuple',\n 'type',\n 'vars',\n 'zip']"},"execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Namespaces are a simple concept.

The first is through assignment (\"statically\"), the second is using list comprehensions(\"actively\").\n\nTo make a static list of items, write them between square brackets. For example:\n`[ 1,2,3,\"This is a list\",'c',Donkey(\"kong\") ]`\n\nA couple of things to look at.\n    1. There are different data types here. Lists in python may contain more than one data type. \n    2. Objects can be created 'on the fly' and added to lists. The last item is a new kind of Donkey. \n\nWriting lists this way is very quick (and obvious). However, it does not take into account the current state of anything else. The other way to make a list is to form it using list comprehension. That means you actually describe the process. To do that, the list is broken into two pieces. The first is a picture of what each element will look like, and the second is what you do to get it.\nFor instance, lets say we have a list of words:\n`listOfWords = [\"this\",\"is\",\"a\",\"list\",\"of\",\"words\"]`\n\nWe will take the first letter of each word and make a list out of it."},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":">>> listOfWords = [\"this\",\"is\",\"a\",\"list\",\"of\",\"words\"]\n>>> items = [ word[0] for word in listOfWords ]\n>>> print(items)","execution_count":265,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"['t', 'i', 'a', 'l', 'o', 'w']\n"}]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"List comprehension allows you to use more than one for statement.

Any variables that are bound in an evaluation remain bound to whatever they were last bound to when the evaluation was completed:\n```python\n>>> print(x, y)\nr t\n```\n\nThis is exactly the same as if the comprehension had been expanded into an explicitly-nested group of one or more 'for' statements and 0 or more 'if' statements.\nList creation shortcuts\nPython provides a shortcut to initialize a list to a particular size and with an initial value for each element:\n```python\n>>> zeros=[0]*5\n>>> print zeros\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\n\nThis works for any data type:\n```python\n>>> foos=['foo']*8\n>>> print foos\n['foo', 'foo', 'foo', 'foo', 'foo', 'foo', 'foo', 'foo']\n```\n\nwith a caveat.

This should normally be used when writing regexps, so that backslashes are interpreted literally rather than having to be escaped.\nRegular expressions consist of: literal characters that match themselves, metacharacters that act as “wild cards”, and quantifiers specify how many times to match the preceding atom (literal, metacharacter or group)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Metacharacters\n\nMetacharacter | Meaning | Regex | Matches\n:--- | :--- | :--- | :---\n`.` | Match any character | `foo.bar` | foodbar\n`^` | Match the beginning of line | `^hi` | lines starting “hi”\n`$` | Match the end of line | `hi$` |lines ending “hi” \n`[ABC]` | Match A or B or C | `h[ae]ll` | hall, hell\n`[^DEF]` |Any character except D or E or F|`h[^ae]ll`|h9ll but not hall\n`[A-Z]` | A character in the range A-Z | `A[A-Z]T` | ANT, but not AnT"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Special Character Sets\n\nChar | Meaning\n:--- | :---\n`\\w` | Word characters, same as `[A-Za-z0-9_]`\n`\\W` | Not word characters, same as `[^A-Za-z0-9_]`\n`\\d` | Digit same as `[0-9]`\n`\\D` | Not Digit, same as `[^0-9]`\n`\\s` | White space, that is space, tab, newline, vspace, hspace etc.\n`\\S` | Not whitespace\n`\\b` |Word break.

It is a relatively simple to learn yet powerful toolkit that provides what appears to be a modest set of widgets. However, because the Tkinter widgets are extensible, many compound widgets can be created rather easily (i.e. combo-box, scrolled panes). Because of its maturity and extensive documentation Tkinter has been designated as the de facto GUI for Python.\nA minimal application\nHere is a trivial Tkinter program containing only a Quit button:\n```python\n1.  #!/usr/local/bin/python\n2.  from Tkinter import *\t\t\t\t\n3.  class Application(Frame):\n4. \tdef __init__(self, master=None):\n5. \t\tFrame.__init__(self, master)\n6.\t\tself.createWidgets()\n7. \tdef createWidgets(self):\n8.\t\tself.quitButton = Button ( self, text='Quit',\n9.\t\t\t\t\t\tcommand=self.quit )\n10.\t\tself.quitButton.grid()\n11. app = Application()\n12. app.master.title(\"Sample application\") \n13. app.mainloop()\n```\nExplanation\n    1. Shebang\n    2. This line imports the entire Tkinter package into your program's namespace.\n    3. Your application class must inherit from Tkinter's Frame class.\n    4. App Constructor.\n    5. Calls the constructor for the parent class, Frame, which is necessary to make the application actually appear on the screen.\n    6. Calls createWidgets method\n    7. Defines createWidgets method\n    8. Creates a button labeled “Quit”.\n    9. Places the button on the application.\n    10. The main program starts here by instantiating the Application class.\n    11. This method call sets the title of the window to “Sample application”.\n    12. Starts the application's main loop, waiting for mouse and keyboard events.\nTo learn more about Tkinter visit the following links:\n- http://www.astro.washington.edu/owen/TkinterSummary.html <- A summary\n- http://infohost.nmt.edu/tcc/help/lang/python/tkinter.html <- A tutorial\n- http://www.pythonware.com/library/tkinter/introduction/ <- A reference"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## PyGTK\nPyGTK provides a convenient wrapper for the GTK+ library for use in Python programs, taking care of many of the boring details such as managing memory and type casting.

Some applications can use SQLite for internal data storage. It’s also possible to prototype an application using SQLite and then port the code to a larger database such as PostgreSQL or Oracle.\n\nThe sqlite3 module was written by Gerhard Häring. It provides a SQL interface compliant with the DB-API 2.0 specification described by PEP 249.\nTo use the module, you must first create a Connection object that represents the database. Here the data will be stored in the example.db file:\n```python\nimport sqlite3\ncon = sqlite3.connect('test.db')\n```\nYou can also supply the special name `:memory:` to create a database in RAM.\nOnce you have a Connection, you can create a Cursor object and call its `execute()` method to perform SQL commands:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"import sqlite3 as db                                           \ncon = db.connect('test.db')                                    \ncur = con.cursor()\n#create a string with sql create table code\nsql = '''CREATE TABLE users(                                   \n            id INT PRIMARY KEY,  \n           username VARCHAR(64),  \n            password VARCHAR(64))'''\n#execute the sql code\ncur.execute(sql)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"#an insert rows into the table using a parameterised tables\nsql = '''INSERT INTO users\n         VALUES (?,?,?)'''\n#execute the query with one row\ncur.execute(sql,[44,'Billy','1234'])\n#execute many rows as a list of tuples\ncur.executemany(sql,[(55,'AA','1'),(56,'BB','2')])\n#sqlite does not auto commit\ncon.commit()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"sql = \"SELECT * FROM users\"\ncur.execute(sql)\nprint(cur.fetchall())","execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"[(1, 'Fred', 'qwerty'), (2, 'Joe', 'qwerty'), (3, 'Bob', 'qwerty'), (44, 'Billy', '1234'), (55, 'AA', '1'), (56, 'BB', '2')]\n"}]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"cur.execute(sql)\nfor row in cur:\n    print(row)","execution_count":13,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"(1, 'Fred', 'qwerty')\n(2, 'Joe', 'qwerty')\n(3, 'Bob', 'qwerty')\n(44, 'Billy', '1234')\n(55, 'AA', '1')\n(56, 'BB', '2')\n"}]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"cur.execute(sql)","execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":"<sqlite3.Cursor at 0xa647a0>"},"execution_count":14,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"cur.fetchone()[1]","execution_count":17,"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":"'Bob'"},"execution_count":17,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"cur.description","execution_count":18,"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":"(('id', None, None, None, None, None, None),\n ('name', None, None, None, None, None, None),\n ('password', None, None, None, None, None, None))"},"execution_count":18,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"[row[0] for row in cur.description]","execution_count":20,"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":"['id', 'name', 'password']"},"execution_count":20,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Postgres connection in Python"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"import psycopg2\nconn = psycopg2.connect(\"dbname=test\")\ncursor = conn.cursor()\ncursor.execute(\"select * from test\");\nfor i in cursor.next():\n    print(i)\nconn.close()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## SQLAlchemy in Action\nSQLAlchemy has become the favorite choice for many large Python projects that use databases. A long, updated list of such projects is listed on the SQLAlchemy site. Additionally, a pretty good tutorial can be found there, as well. Along with a thin database wrapper, Elixir, it behaves very similarly to the ORM in Rails, ActiveRecord.\n\n## Generic Database Connectivity using ODBC\nThe Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) API standard allows transparent connections with any database that supports the interface. This includes most popular databases, such as PostgreSQL or Microsoft Access. The strengths of using this interface is that a Python script or module can be used on different databases by only modifying the connection string.\n\nThere are three ODBC modules for Python:\n    1. PythonWin ODBC Module: provided by Mark Hammond with the PythonWin package for Microsoft Windows (only). This is a minimal implementation of ODBC, and conforms to Version 1.0 of the Python Database API. Although it is stable, it will likely not be developed any further.[3] \n    2. mxODBC: a commercial Python package (http://www.egenix.com/products/python/mxODBC/), which features handling of DateTime objects and prepared statements (using parameters). \n    3. pyodbc: an open-source Python package (http://code.google.com/p/pyodbc), which uses only native Python data-types and uses prepared statements for increased performance.

PREAMBLE\nThe purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.\nThis License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.\nWe have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\nThis License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.\nA \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.\nA \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.\nThe \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.\nThe \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\nA \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\".\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.\nThe \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.\nA section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition.\nThe Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.\n2. VERBATIM COPYING\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.\n3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\nIf you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n4. MODIFICATIONS\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\nA. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. \nB. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. \nC. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. \nD. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. \nE. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. \nF. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. \nG. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice. \nH. Include an unaltered copy of this License. \nI. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. \nJ. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. \nK. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. \nL. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. \nM. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. \nN. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. \nO. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. \nIf the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\nYou may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.\n5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\". You must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements.\"\n6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.\n8. TRANSLATION\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.\n9. TERMINATION\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.\nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.13","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
